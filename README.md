# youtube_download
A program to download videos from youtube
This program lets you download a single or multiple videos from YouTube.

To download a single video, you only need to enter the link of the video and the download_single function will be called. The program will ask you to type in your desired resolution from the available ones and a dialog box to choose the folder in which you want the video to be saved.

In order to download multiple videos, you need to enter the number of videos, each video link and wether you want the highest resolution or the lowest resolution for each video to be downloaded. The program will then call the download_multiple function.

Feel free to customize the program to match your needs :)
